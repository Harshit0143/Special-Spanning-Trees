# Special-Spanning-Trees
* A ```Special Spanning tree``` with respect to an edge ```e``` of a ```Graph```,
is a spanning tree of a ```connected undirected graph``` that contains ```e``` and has the minimum possible total ```weight```.  
Here we are given a graph in form of the ```edges```. We need to determine the ```weight``` of each ```Special Spanning tree``` w.r.t. each ```edge``` of the ```Graph```. 
 All this in ```O(n*log(n))``` time. 


Requires Advanced Concepts: 
* Binary Lifting 
* Disjoint Set Union
